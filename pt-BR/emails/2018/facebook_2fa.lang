;This is a huge breach of trust by Facebook (again!) This isn’t just bad for Facebook — it undermines trust in a key security feature, two factor authentication, that is used across the internet to help keep sensitive information safer. That’s not okay.

;Facebook has responded to public pressure to change their practices before. That’s why we’re asking you to <strong>add your name to a petition demanding that Facebook immediately stop using phone numbers it received for two factor authentication to target advertising.</strong>

;This is yet another example of Facebook breaching the trust of people who rely on its service to maintain connections with their friends and family. Enough is enough.
