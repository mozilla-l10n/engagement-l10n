;Hey, nice work choosing Firefox for your web journeys. Not all heroes wear capes — by browsing with us, you have a direct impact on the causes shaping the future of the internet.
Ei! Bom trabalho ao escolher o Firefox para sua jornada na Web. Nem todos os heróis vestem capas — ao navegar conosco, você impacta diretamente em causas que estão moldando o futuro da Internet.


;How? Because by “us,” we mean not just Firefox, but Mozilla, the technology nonprofit that backs us. Mozilla brings internet education to people all over the world, fights for your online rights and keeps corporate power in check.
Como? Por “nós,” queremos dizer não apenas o Firefox, mas a Mozilla, a tecnologia sem fins lucrativos que nos apoia. A Mozilla trouxe a educação para Internet, para pessoas em todo o mundo, luta por seus direitos on-line e mantém o poder corporativo sob controle.


;You’re already doing good. And together we can do more. Learn how you can rock the power of your internet citizenship.

Firefox is part of Mozilla’s mission to keep you in control of your online experience and ensure that the web stays weird, healthy and inviting to all.
