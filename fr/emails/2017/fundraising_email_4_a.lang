;Dear <name>,
Bonjour <name>,


;You, my friend, are a <s>very</s> good person.
You, my friend, are a <s>very</s> good person.


;How do we know this? Because this is the 4th fundraising email we’ve sent in the past two months and here you are, taking a couple minutes of your day to read it. You could have clicked “delete”. Instead, here you are, still reading.
Comment nous le savons&nbsp;? Eh bien parce qu’il s’agit du 4e appel aux dons que nous vous envoyons en moins de deux&nbsp;mois, et que vous prenez quelques minutes de votre temps pour le lire. Vous auriez pu cliquer sur «&nbsp;Supprimer&nbsp;», mais non. Vous êtes bien là, à nous lire.


;And here we are, still asking for money. It’s often the worst part of working for a non-profit (the Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit btw, no shareholders or stock options here) — always asking others for money so we can do our do-gooder work.
